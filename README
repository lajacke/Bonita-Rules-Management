Obs: All exception are added by UUIDs. Some kind of exception, like "Labels" do not have a friendly UUDIs.

TODOs:
*Make it possibel to add Labels by name instead of UUIDs.
*Beautify code. This code was almost  try/error based, and this is the first working version. So it is not beautiful at all. It needs a very good refactoring.
*Use Groovy. I'm not a groovy programer, so all my groovy code is not more than java. I'm sure someone more experienced with it could do better.
*Sanitize input. I'm not yet verifying if input data are valid.
*Improve user interface. Sorry :/ it is not that friendly.
